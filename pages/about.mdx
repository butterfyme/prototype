# About butterfy

Butterfy is a democratic collection of meaningful content. Sourced and curated by the people, not by an algorithm or a newsroom. Here, you decide in a 4-staged voting process together with everyone else what content has the potential for impact. Looking for the signal within the noise. We call that crowdfiltering.

Content that makes it through the 4-staged crowdfiltering transforms from an Egg (1) into a Caterpillar (2), a Chrysalis (3) and finally into a Butterfly. Or rather, a Butterfy (4).

Start by laying an Egg or exploring the Eggs others have laid already.

Let's butterfy the Internet!
