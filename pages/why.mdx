# We become what we feed ourselves.

Today, media and tech companies centrally decide for us what information we are feeding ourselves. They cannot have our best interest in mind because with their for-profit business models they are bound to make money first and foremost.

As a result, we often end up losing ourselves in filter bubbles and feeding ourselves with junk food for our mind. Just because corporations figured out this is what makes us click, keeps us hooked and brings them their much craved profit. Very backwards, if you ask us.

What if we could democratize the decision of what we collectively feed ourselves? Without filter bubbles or a profit motive but with a societal growth motive.

We believe consuming only healthy food for our **mind** will become as common tomorrow, as consuming only healthy food for our **body** is today.
